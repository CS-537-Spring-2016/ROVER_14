3.Range Extender

The Wheels have the following functions and characteristics:
->Wheels can move over terrain the fastest of any drive system.
->Wheels can travel over Soil and Gravel.

->Wheels will immediately get stuck upon entering Sand terrain.

The first tool which we have is CHEMICAL_SENSOR:
It comes under Organic Science

The second tool which we have is RANGE Extender:
This tools extends scanner range from a 7x7 square to an 11x11 square.
